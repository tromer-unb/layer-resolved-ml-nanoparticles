# Atomic structures

This directory contains the atomic structures used in this work.

- File format: `.xyz`
- Naming convention: `i.xyz` corresponds to structure ID = i
- All structures share the same global composition but differ in atomic ordering

The structures are used as input for:
- layer-resolved descriptor construction
- physical layer-by-layer analysis
- ranking and active learning
